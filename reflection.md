- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inhertiance is very nice for programming because it means you do not have to re-write a bunch of methods if something is a more specific version of something else. For example, since a cafe is a type of building it is nice that you do not have to write a toString for each of the Cafe, House, and Library. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment went very smooth overall. The only thing I struggled with was making sure i was using super in the constructor correctly. Additionally, I ran into an error with returning a null when working with the hashtables but it was relatively easy to debug. The advice i would give to someone taking this course is utilize the in class examples when working on your homework.
